# Auto MPG Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the **Auto MPG Dataset Analysis** repository! This project explores and analyzes the classic **Auto MPG Dataset**, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving insights from automobile performance metrics.

## 🚗 Dataset Description

The Auto MPG dataset provides data for various automobile models and their respective miles per gallon (MPG) performance. Key features include:

- `mpg`: Miles per gallon
- `cylinders`: Number of cylinders
- `displacement`: Engine displacement (in cubic inches)
- `horsepower`: Horsepower
- `weight`: Vehicle weight
- `acceleration`: Time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (in seconds)
- `model_year`: Year of manufacture
- `origin`: Origin of the car (1: USA, 2: Europe, 3: Japan)
- `car_name`: Name of the car

## 🛠️ Key Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing or invalid data entries to ensure consistency.
2. **Data Exploration:** Perform descriptive statistics and visualization to understand the data distribution and trends.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Explore relationships between variables and create new features where applicable.
4. **Modeling (Optional):** Use the dataset to build predictive models for estimating MPG based on other features.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`AutoMpg.ipynb`**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and code implementation.
- **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the project.
- **`data/`**: (Optional) Directory for storing the dataset files.
- **`results/`**: (Optional) Directory for storing results, plots, or models.
