# Social Media Analytics Project

This project is a Python-based data analytics application that uses randomly generated social media data to analyze engagement metrics across different categories. The primary objective is to demonstrate data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis techniques using libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. 

## Project Overview

The project is structured as a series of tasks, each contributing to the overall process of analyzing social media engagement data. It starts with importing necessary libraries, generating random data, cleaning the data, and then visualizing and analyzing engagement metrics.

## Installation

To get started, ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Alternatively, you can use the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Task 1**: Import required libraries
- **Task 2**: Generate random data (Date, Category, Likes)
- **Task 3**: Load data into a DataFrame and perform initial exploration
- **Task 4**: Clean the data (handle null values, duplicates, and format data types)
- **Task 5**: Visualize and analyze data
- **Task 6**: Draw conclusions from findings

## Data Generation

The dataset simulates social media post engagement across categories like Food, Travel, Fashion, Fitness, Music, Culture, Family, and Health. Random dates, categories, and like counts are generated for each post. The data dictionary includes:
- `Date`: Random dates for the posts.
- `Category`: Randomly chosen categories.
- `Likes`: Random integer values representing the number of likes per post.

Example code snippet for data generation:
```python
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range('2021-01-01', periods=500),
    'Category': [random.choice(categories) for _ in range(500)],
    'Likes': np.random.randint(0, 10000, size=500)
}
```

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning ensures the quality and consistency of the dataset. Key cleaning steps include:
- Removing null values and duplicate records.
- Converting the `Date` column to a datetime format.
- Ensuring `Likes` is stored as an integer.

## Data Analysis & Visualization

Several visualizations and statistical analyses were conducted to explore the data:
- **Histogram** of likes across all categories to understand engagement distribution.
- **Boxplot** of `Likes` by `Category` to compare engagement across different categories.
- **Statistical Analysis** including the overall average likes and category-wise average likes.

### Sample Code for Visualization

```python
sns.histplot(df['Likes'])
plt.show()

sns.boxplot(x='Category', y='Likes', data=df)
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to analyzing social media engagement data. Key findings and insights are documented, and suggestions for further analysis are provided. The project offers potential improvements, such as refining category definitions or integrating real-world data, to enhance analysis accuracy.
