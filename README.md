# Auto MPG Analysis and Linear Regression

This project involves the analysis of the **Auto MPG dataset**, which provides data on the fuel efficiency of cars along with their specifications. The analysis includes cleaning, visualization, and building a linear regression model to predict fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, `mpg`).

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing and incorrect values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using visualization techniques to identify trends and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Standardizing features for machine learning models.
4. **Linear Regression**: Implementing a linear regression model from scratch and comparing its performance with Scikit-learn's implementation.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The **Auto MPG dataset** includes the following attributes:
- `mpg`: Miles per gallon (fuel efficiency).
- `cylinders`: Number of engine cylinders.
- `displacement`: Engine displacement.
- `horsepower`: Engine horsepower.
- `weight`: Vehicle weight.
- `acceleration`: Acceleration from 0-60 mph.
- `model_year`: Year of manufacture.
- `origin`: Country of origin.
- `car_name`: Name of the car (not used in regression analysis).

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Replaced invalid `horsepower` values ("?") with the median value after converting the column to numeric.
   - Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
   - Removed the `car_name` column, as it is non-numeric and not useful for regression.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized outliers in numerical columns using boxplots.
   - Analyzed feature correlations using a heatmap to identify relationships between variables.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler` for better performance in regression models.

4. **Linear Regression**:
   - Built a **custom linear regression model** using gradient descent.
   - Evaluated the custom model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Compared performance with Scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` model.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Compared MSE of custom and Scikit-learn implementations:
     - Custom implementation MSE: **8.52**
     - Scikit-learn implementation MSE: **7.91**

### Key Code Snippets

- **Correlation Heatmap**:
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(df[numerical_cols].corr(), cmap="coolwarm", annot=True)
plt.title("Correlation Matrix")
plt.show()
```

- **Custom Linear Regression Implementation**:
```python
def linear_reg(X, y, alpha, Iteration):
    X["bias"] = 1
    theta = np.zeros(X.shape[1])
    X = X.values
    y = y.values
    m = len(X)
    cost_list = []
    for i in range(Iteration):
        h_theta = np.dot(X, theta)
        cost = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum((h_theta - y)**2)
        gradient = (1/m) * np.dot(X.T, (h_theta - y))
        theta -= alpha * gradient
        cost_list.append(cost)
    return theta, cost_list
```

## Key Insights

1. **Correlations**:
   - Weight and displacement are negatively correlated with `mpg`, indicating heavier cars tend to have lower fuel efficiency.
   - Horsepower and `mpg` also show a negative correlation.
   
2. **Linear Regression Model**:
   - Both the custom and Scikit-learn models performed well, with Scikit-learn achieving slightly lower MSE.
   - Gradient descent was successfully implemented and visualized using the cost function over iterations.

## Conclusion

This project showcases end-to-end handling of a regression problem:
- Cleaning and preparing data for machine learning.
- Implementing a linear regression model from scratch.
- Comparing custom implementation with Scikit-learn for validation.

Future improvements could involve:
- Exploring additional features or interactions between variables.
- Applying advanced regression techniques such as Ridge or Lasso regression.
